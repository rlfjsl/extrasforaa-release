Welcome to Extras For AA, the most advanced way to personalize Android Auto's look.

This theme is based on Substratum Theme Engine and needs Substratum or Substratum lite to work.

## SYNERGY SUPPORT IS (CURRENTLY) UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A LIMITATION OF SAMSUNG THEME STORE

## How to use it?

In order to use Extras For AA you'll need to have Substratum installed on your phone. Based on Android version, **you may want to check out first if your phone is compatible with Substratum Lite**, which packs some more features than Substratum (ironic, ain't it?). If your device is compatbile with Substratum Lite, install Extras For AA and start playing with it. If your phone is not compatible with Substratum Lite, install normal Substratum and **be sure to download Extras For AA (Legacy) **

There are many options available and you can tweak the appeareance of a lot of things

What you can customize:

- Reduce or remove bottom bar of AA
- Reduce or remove status bar
- Customize the bar leaving just the launcher button or combine it with notifications button -and/or quick access app
- Swap the launcher button with the clock, thanks to madness mode
- Pick your favourite gradient and apply it to what you'd like! Bar, widget or heads up notifications
- Customize colours of various things such as accent (bottom widget), bottom bar, caption of -apps
- Customize heads up notifications making them translucent, smaller, or even gradient-coloured!
- Choose between all the status bar customization
- Make notification center (or notifications) transparent
- Much much more!

**There are also some things you should know about Substratum and the options available, I strongly reccomend to take a look to the FAQ and known issues document before get started: ttps://telegra.ph/EXTRAS-FOR-AA---FAQ-AND-KNOWN-ISSUES-10-15 **

## Extras For AA Icons Special

Extras For AA Icons Special is the special edition of Extras For AA, which has options dedicated to just icon swapping for Android Auto. With Extras For AA Icons Special you can customize:

- Exit Icons
- Status Bar Icons
- Bottom bar Icons
- More to come!

**Extras For AA Icons Special has no Legacy version**


**Warning** If Extras For AA gets updated is also a general good practice to make a clean install of overlays, so in order to avoid errors, uninstall previously built overlays, then you can install them again. If Android Auto gets updated **you MUST reinstall every option** otherwise Android Auto will likely fail to start :)
